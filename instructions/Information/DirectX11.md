# Description
Helldivers 2 runs on DirectX 12, but can be forced to use DirectX 11 instead. This can sometimes improve performance and get rid of some problems.

Please Note: This doesn't mean the game can be run on a GPU that only supports DirectX 11 or is limited to use feature Level DirectX11. There are no updates that can grant them the capability to utilize features exclusive to DX12.

It's also important to note that AMD users may be unable to start the game at all. Also in some configurations and constellations utilizing DX11 can lead to having a worse performance than on DX12 with things such as microstutters.
# How to Enable
* In order to enable DirectX, right click the game in Steam and then pick "Properties".
* In the `Launch Options` textbox, add `--use-d3d11`
