# Description
In order to provide optimal help it is required to receive information by the users asking for support. This template is meant to ease the process and speed up the whole thing.
# Overview
1. Provide your system specs: CPU, GPU and Memory.
    - Include number of memory modules and capacity, and if your memory is two separate kits.
2. Include any overclocking/underclocking/undervolting in your description.  
    - This includes [[Memory Issues|XMP/EXPO]]/DOCP/PBO/Multicore Enhancement.
    - This includes factory overclocks for GPUs.
3. State the driver version for your GPU that you are running. (See [[GPU Drivers]])
    - **ALL** NVIDIA 57x.xx drivers are currently causing stuttering, blackscreens, and crashes. If you are on NVIDIA 4000 series or lower, use driver 566.36.,
    - **VEGA GPUs/Ryzen APUs** require Adrenaline driver 22.11.2.,
4. Provide a detailed description of the problem. "It crashes on startup" is not helpful to anyone.  
    - Kill it with detail: Do you see the gameguard splash? Is there an error shown? Do you see the intro video? Has the game ever launched before? Do you crash only on a specific planet? Do you crash only on city maps or only on outdoor maps? Do you crash only with a specific loadout?
5. Be explicit about what you have already done. "I tried everything" means we have to ask you a billion questions about what you actually did.,
6. We are going to ask you to run bobthebuilders [[Hellbomb Script]].
	1. Include your hellbomb script output if you already ran it. This can be screenshots of the script output, or copypasta from the terminal window.

Note: [[Mods]] are breaking the game AGAIN. If you are seeing error `0x44415441`, you have a problem with your mods or you uninstalled them improperly. Many mods persist through game reinstalls and file verifies, and even disabling them in HD2MM won't necessarily remove them. Ask for the `broken` tag for more information.
