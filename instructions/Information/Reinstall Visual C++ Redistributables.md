# Description
Sometimes it is necessary to reinstall the VC++ Redistributables.

Note: Repair installs DO NOT always fix it. (They usually don't). Uninstall does not equal a repair install.
# How to
1. Go to Control Panel -> Programs -> Programs and Features
2. Look for **all three** of the following:
	- Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable (x64),
	- Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x64),
	- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64),
3. If any of the three are there, `uninstall` all of them.
	1. `restart` the computer
	2. use the Hellbomb Script (https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript)" option `[I]` to `install` them (or download them from Microsoft)
4. If any are missing `install` them and `restart`.
