Deleting the `shader_cache` folder often restores lost [[Performance + Settings|performance]]. It can also solve crashing issues if you are seeing purple `?` in game, or crashing due to a specific stratagem or weapon.

After every new patch/update, it is best practice to delete the `shader_cache` folder from `%APPDATA%\Arrowhead\Helldivers2` before you play. The game will make a fresh `shader_cache` on startup if it does not exist.

Note: If you delete the whole `Helldivers2` folder it will also wipe your `user_settings.config` file, so you will have to redo any menu changes you've made such as graphics settings.
