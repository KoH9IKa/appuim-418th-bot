Some players like to use third party software, such as

* Helldivers Companion App
* ThrottleStop
* Process Lasso

etc.

Players use this software on their own risk. If they decide to use it and something breaks there is nothing we can do about it.

Especially in the case of ThrottleStop it is advised to refrain from using it if you have no experience whatsoever - that tool allows to *DEACTIVATE THERMAL THROTTLING*, meaning you can fry your own hardware. It can also lead to your power supply to draw in more power than it should, also creating more heat and potentially becoming a fire hazard in the worst of circumstances.
