# Description
Attempting to edit the Weapon Attachments causes crashes for some players. This is a bug Arrowhead is aware of and is working on.
# Workaround
For the time being we have a workaround:

1. Drop into any mission, any difficulty.
2. Fire a shot.
3. Return to ship.

The weapon you took on the mission will now be customizable. Repeat the steps for any weapon causing crashes when you attempt to customize it.

There is currently another bug that causes a CTD when previewing an attachment you don't have and swapping to the weapon skin menu.

There is no workaround, just make sure it's on an attachment you have.
