# Description
The Game repeatedly fails to verify 5 files. This is NOT an issue but rather normal. The files in question most likely are:

* `nplsb.des`
* `nplsm.des`
* `SONYGame.ini`
* `npggNT.des`
* `npggNT64.des`

This is actually normal behaviour and can be confirmed by an official post by Valve: https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB

This is only a problem if the **MORE** than 5 files are failing to verify.
