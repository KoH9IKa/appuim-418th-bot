# Description
Egypt seems to block certain VoIP ports which the PS5 needs in order to establish some online connectivity. This also prevents them from connecting to other players.
# Solutions
There is no definitive guide to it. It seems that a VPN is able to do the trick, but it might be that the user requires additional Hardware to run the VPN. But the details are blurry at best.

It is generally not advised to do so since this might be in conflict with local laws and restrictions - so any user who really wants to attempt this will do it at their own risk, as Egypt might has banned the use of VPN in general.
