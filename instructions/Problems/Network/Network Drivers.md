# Description
There are prevalent link drop issues with both Intel i225v/i226v and Realtek RTL81** 2.5Gb network adapters. These are common adapters shipping since 2019/2020.

These random link drops are followed up by very fast reconnects. They happen so fast, that Windows will not notify the user. There will be entries in the Windows System Event Log that show the drops and reconnects. Link drops and reconnects such as these can cause disconnects in many titles, not just Helldivers2.
# How to check Network adapter Type and driver version
Both Intel and Realtek recently(February 2025) released new drivers that are intended to address these specific link drops.

These driver packages are compatible with many Intel and Realtek network adapters. If you have an Intel or Realtek network adapter that is 1Gb, 2.5Gb, 5Gb or 10Gb, you can use these packages to update your network drivers.
