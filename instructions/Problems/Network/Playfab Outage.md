In case that Playfab is unavailable in a region, users can try and flush their DNS. Sometimes this can work and reestablish connectivity.

The user has to follow these steps
1. Press `[Win] + [R]` or use the Windows Search Bar
2. Type in `CMD`
3. Right Click and choose `Run as Admin`
4. Type in `ipconfig /flushdns`

This will lead to a temporary crash on Weapon Customization until after the first combat mission.
