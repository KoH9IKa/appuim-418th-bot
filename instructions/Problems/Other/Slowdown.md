# Description
The user is moving noticably slower than they should be or the game feels like it's running in slowmotion.
# Possible Solutions
One user reported that the settings of the game reverted the problem.
"I was able to correct this by setting my display resolution back to its dynamic value (this had changed to the monitor's default resolution) and changing the resolution scaling to ultra quality."
