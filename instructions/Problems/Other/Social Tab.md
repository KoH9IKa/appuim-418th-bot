# Description
To make a long story short, the social tab is pretty much broken.  It was supposed to be worked on/fixed with the Aug 6th update but there are still some remaining issues in the meantime there are some steps you can try. Most are PC specific. 
# Solutions
* On PS5 you can clear PS5 cache and delete your PSN Cloud save for Helldivers2 if "Social Tab/Please Wait Democratically" is what needs fixed
	* Make sure you have Crossplay on
* On PC it might have something to do with profile settings, so have your PC friend check these steps as well:
	* Close the game
	* Delete the Helldivers2 folder from %appdata%\Arrowhead
	* Go to Steam Profile
	* Edit Profile
	* Privacy Settings
	* Set "My Profile" to "Public"
## Add Friends
* Start by checking your blocklists and making sure Crossplay is on (even if you're both on the same platform)
* Have the senders cancel any pending friend requests. DO NOT decline or Remove Friend at any point anywhere doing so will likely block the player and the only fix is to have AH clear the blocklist for you
* Once cancelled, on the PC open the Social tab, and generate a Friend Code, give this to the PS5 players but DO NOT close the social tab. keep it open until you get the new request  

If still unsuccessful or if they are blocked and you cannot unblock, [Click here to submit a ticket to AH](https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new "Click here to submit a ticket to AH (https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)"), ask them to clear your blocklist
# Other Solutions
In case the players can't join their friends or vice versa, direct them to [[General Network Troubleshooting]] and [[Network Drivers]]. If the issue persists despite following these guides, then it is most likely an issue with their ISP.
