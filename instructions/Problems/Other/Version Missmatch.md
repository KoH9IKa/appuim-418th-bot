# Problem
The users copy of Helldivers 2 is not updated to the latest Versions.

Errors include
* not being able to dive with others (not to be confused with [[General Network Troubleshooting]])
* Superstore not showing any items
* Functions missing that were added in later patches
* Outdated Galaxy Map
# Problem
* The Game failed to update and could only download the release Version or another earlier Version
# Solution
First check the Version in the Options Menu (lower left corner). If the version does not match the current release then follow these steps:
* Make sure to get rid of all Network problems that prevent updates from happening.
* If no Network problems persist and the problem lies with Steam, then delete Steam Cache and restart it and use the [[Hellbomb Script]]. Afterwards reopen Steam. After clearing Steam Cache verify Helldivers 2 and it should trigger the update.
# Attention
If a user is asking why they are not seeing the Weapon Customization Menu - that is locked behind a level requirement of 10.
