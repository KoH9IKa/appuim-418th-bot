- Delete the HD2 cloud save from PSN,
- Make sure you are using Performance mode (or try Quality if you're on Performance) to see if that makes a difference,
- Older PS5s seem to have more trouble, maybe look into cleaning the fan and internals to make sure you are getting good airflow.
- Reinstall Helldivers 2 to see if that helps,
- Network disconnects can usually be solved by going wired instead of wifi, and powering off your home internet for at least 5-6 min,
- If you have the game installed on a HDD try installing it on a SSD
