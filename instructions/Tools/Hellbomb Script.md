# False Positives
* Sometimes the Hellbomb Script will say that the UEFI hasn't been updated despite the fact that it was - it's practically impossible to get every Mainboard right, so it is important that the user keeps track of that themselves.
* The System Clock sometimes is being called out as being wrong, but that too can be resolved by manually checking the System Time of their device.
